# passport-appointment-check
Simple python script that checks the governments website to see whether urgent passport appointments are online or not. 
If the site changes it sends you a text.

You need a basic free twilio account to get it running but that's it. Get one here https://www.twilio.com/ .

You also need the twilio python library installed which you can get here https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python 

It got me a passport. Hope it helps you.
